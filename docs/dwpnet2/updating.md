# Updating Your Net2+

![](/static/assets/banners/whg_net2update.png)

Keep the doors from closing in on you.

!!!
Before getting started, download the latest version of this product from [Axon](https://axon.whitehill.group).
!!!
!!!warning
This page assumes familiarity with Roblox Studio's Explorer and basic model hierarchy manipulation.
!!!

---

=== Step 1 - Preparations
- Duplicate your door model and store it outside your workspace.

In case anything goes south, you will always have a restore point.
===

=== Step 2 - Updating
- From a fresh copy of Net2+, under `DWProx Net2+` **->** `PaxtonSettings` there's a `Loader` script, copy it.
- For every door using Net2+, follow the same path, and replace the old `Loader` script with the new `Loader`.

!!!warning
DWProx Net2+ doesn't have a deployment/global script. All doors/Net2+ installs **need to be updated manually**.
!!!
===

=== Step 3 - Test
After updating all/one of the doors, test if it boots and functions without throwing any errors to the Console.

!!!
In case any errors occur, check the release notes in [**#product-updates**](https://ptb.discord.com/channels/616745092279173151/1169430975911043212) for any special instructions.
