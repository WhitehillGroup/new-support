=== 1. Insert your file.
This product doesn't use Axon licensing, meaning it can be inserted via [Toolbox](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/6821432149/KONE-Turnstiles) directly in Studio.
===

=== 2. Placement & Positioning.
You are free to move, rotate and scale the turnstiles to your liking.

!!!info
The turnstile models aren't folder dependant, allowing you to change their placement in Explorer. Please note that changing the model itself can break the system.
!!!
===

=== 3. Configure your Turnstiles.
While the Turnstiles are designed to work immediately, we recommend reviewing the configuration module `Settings`, found under each turnstile, to perfect your experience.

!!!info
For more information check out the [Configuration](/turnstiles/configuration.md) page.
