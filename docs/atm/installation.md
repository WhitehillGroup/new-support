=== 1. Insert your file.
To import your file, simply drag the product file into Roblox Studio once your game is fully loaded. 
Alternatively, you can use the Explorer context menu by right-clicking and selecting **Insert > Insert From File**.
===

=== 2. Placement & Positioning.
You are free to move, rotate and scale the ATM models to your liking, although make sure they're all located within the `JSM | ATM V3` **->** `Terminals` folder.

!!!info
Any misplaced models **will not** work, keeping them in their respective folders is required.

=== 3. Configure your ATMs.
While the ATM terminals are designed to work immediately, we recommend reviewing the configuration module found under `JSM | ATM V3` **->** `SystemConfig` to perfect your experience.
