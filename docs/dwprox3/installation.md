# DWProx v3 Installation

!!! This product is free
No licence is required to use DWProx v3 - get it on the [Roblox library](https://www.roblox.com/library/4998244735).
!!!

1. Insert file from the studio toolbox, after getting the model [here](https://www.roblox.com/library/4998244735).

2. Ungroup the model using `CTRL + U`

3. Use the built in Roblox movement tools to position the inserted doors and readers.
You can change the Readers and Buttons used on each door by placing the readers and buttons you wish to use in the applicable folders via the roblox explorer, But remember to delete any unneeded ones!
!!!warning
There are a number of reasons your doors may not be working correctly after this step. These include:
- The doors colliding with parts (These may be invisible or unions with incorrect collisions)
- 'Join Surfaces' is enabled. This will weld your doors to any parts they collide with whilst you are installing them.
- Using 3rd party movement tools such as 'Building Tools by F3X' have been known to break our doors during installation.
!!!

4. Configure your doors. Door-related settings are located in the 'Settings' script located immediately within the door model. Access control settings are located within the 'Settings' script located immediately within the DWProx model
