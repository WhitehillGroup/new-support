If you're using Studio's standard rotation tools, make sure to select everything within the product's group to prevent welds from being automatically removed."]},{"l":"Why are my products saying that HTTP Service is not enabled, even though it is?","p":["There are a few possible causes for this error. Please check the following:","Double-check that HTTP Requests are enabled in Home > Game Settings > Security. It's easy to miss clicking \"Save\" after enabling it.","HTTP requests may not work in local (non-published) games. Make sure your game is published to Roblox. You will need to restart Roblox Studio after doing this.","Too many scripts are making HTTP requests. While our products are optimized to minimize HTTP usage and avoid hitting Roblox’s limits, other scripts in your game may still generate enough requests to exceed those limits. If our products are unable to connect due to this, they will automatically retry after a short period. However, if the issue persists, they may fail to start. We recommend identifying and removing any scripts that may be overloading HTTP Service."]},{"l":"Are there items provided with any of our retail products?","p":["We provide an example item with each of our products; however, it's up to you to create the items for your game.
