# AutoPro API

![](/assets/banners/whg_apapi.png)

Make the doors open by themselves. Or don't.

AutoPro is our most advanced automatic door system designed for convenience and efficiency, providing seamless access control for any environment. Each AutoPro instance has a singular `API` [BindableFunction](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BindableFunction).

Located directly in the root folder after **game startup**, the API allows you to interface easily with the doors.

## Syntax

```lua
workspace["AutoPro v2"]:WaitForChild("API"):Invoke(Protocol, Event)
```
!!!light What do these mean?
- **Protocol**: (`string`) This will always be "api".
- **Event**: (`string`) Function for AutoPro to execute.
!!!
AutoPro's function list is as follows:
- `"Open"`: Used to open the door. _(Door Mode "Normal" or "Exit")_
- `"ReaderOpen"`: For use with access control. _(Door Mode "Locked" or "Exit")_
- `"ReaderClose"`: For use with access control. _(Door Mode "Locked" or "Exit")_

!!!info Note
Changing the mode of operation is only available via the door controller. You can change the start-up mode by following steps in the AutoPro [configuration](/autopro/configuration.md) guide.
