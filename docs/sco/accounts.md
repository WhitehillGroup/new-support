Your default accounts module, found under `JSM | SelfCheckout V3` **->** `SystemConfig` **->** `Accounts`, is structured as follows:

```lua
--[[
	           _______ __  ___
	          / / ___//  |/  /
	     __  / /\__ \/ /|_/ / 
	    / /_/ /___/ / /  / /  
	    \____//____/_/  /_/
 	      Self Checkout v3

    For additional security, it is recomended to only login with an operator barcode, however passcodes can be used if prefered.
	
]]--

local OperatorID = {		
	["1"] = {
		["Name"] = "DefaultCashier",
		["Type"] = "Employee",
		["Password"] = "1234"
	},	
	["2"] = {
		["Name"] = "DefaultManager",
		["Type"] = "Manager",
		["Password"] = "1234"
	},
	["3"] = {
		["Name"] = "DefaultAdministrator",
		["Type"] = "Administrator",
		["Password"] = "1234"
	},
}
return OperatorID
```
