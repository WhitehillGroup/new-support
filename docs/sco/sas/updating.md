=== Step 1 - Preparations
- Duplicate your `JSM | Scan & Shop` model and store it outside your workspace.

In case anything goes south, you will always have a restore point.
===

=== Step 2 - Updating
- From the fresh copy of S&S, copy the `CoreEngine` script. (Inside `JSM | Scan & Shop`)
- In your existing installation, delete the old `CoreEngine` script, and paste in the new `CoreEngine` script.
===

=== Step 3 - Test
After updating, confirm that the Scan & Shop boots and functions without throwing any errors to the Console.

!!!
In case any errors occur, check the release notes in [**#product-updates**](https://ptb.discord.com/channels/616745092279173151/1169430975911043212) for any special instructions.
