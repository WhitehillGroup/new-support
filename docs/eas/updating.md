# Updating Intelli-Sense EAS

![](/static/assets/banners/whg_easupdate.png)

Keep detecting. Keep up your EAS.

!!!
Before getting started, download the latest version of this product from [Axon](https://axon.whitehill.group).
!!!
!!!warning
This page assumes familiarity with Roblox Studio's Explorer and basic model hierarchy manipulation.

=== Step 1 - Preparations
- Duplicate your `JSM | Intelli-Sense EAS` folder and store it outside your workspace.

In case anything goes south, you will always have a restore point.
===

=== Step 2 - Updating
Gates:
- From the fresh copy of EAS, copy the `Script` script. (Inside `JSM | Intelli-Sense EAS` **->** `JSM | EAS Evolve/Synergy/NEO Gate`, doesn't matter from which gate you source it.)
- In your existing installation, delete the old `Script` script in every gate, and paste in the new `Script` script.

Controller:
- From the fresh copy of EAS, copy the `Controller` script.
- In your existing controller, delete the old `Controller` script, and paste in the new script.
===

=== Step 3 - Test
After updating, confirm that the EAS boots and functions without throwing any errors to the Console.

!!!
In case any errors occur, check the release notes in [**#product-updates**](https://ptb.discord.com/channels/616745092279173151/1169430975911043212) for any special instructions.
