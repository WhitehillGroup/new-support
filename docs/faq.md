# Frequently Asked Questions

![](/assets/banners/whg_faq.png)

Check out our frequently asked questions, the answer you're looking for might already be here.

==- How can I access my products?
You can purchase and download all of our products easily through our user-friendly dashboard. Visit [Axon](https://axon.whitehill.group) to get started.

==- Can I purchase products without using Robux?
Yes! All purchases can be made through [Axon](https://axon.whitehill.group).

==- Do you offer product transfers?
Yes. We've introduced product transfers through [Axon](https://axon.whitehill.group), allowing you greater flexibility and control over how and where you use your products.

==- Can I join the support team?
We rarely open applications for new support team members, as our current team is typically sufficient to handle support volume. While we occasionally post openings, most of our new members are hand-selected. Keep an eye out for announcements regarding future opportunities.

==- Why do my products become unanchored after rotating them in-game?
If you’re using the F3X plugin in Studio, please avoid doing so with our products. It can break welds. When using Roblox Studio’s built-in rotation tools, ensure you select everything within the product's group to prevent welds from being automatically removed.

==- Why am I receiving an error saying HTTP Service is not enabled, even though it is?
This issue can occur for several reasons. Please review the following:
1. Verify that **HTTP Requests** are enabled in **Home > Game Settings > Security**, and ensure you clicked **Save** after enabling it.
2. HTTP requests do not work in local (unpublished) games. Publish your game to Roblox and restart Studio afterward.
3. Too many scripts may be making HTTP requests. Although our products are optimized to minimize HTTP usage, excessive requests from other scripts may exceed Roblox's limits. Our products will automatically retry after a short delay, but persistent overloads can cause startup failures. Identify and remove any scripts that may be overloading HTTP Service.

==- Are example items included with retail products?
Yes. Each product includes one example item to demonstrate setup and configuration. You're responsible for creating your own items using this example as a reference.

==- Why am I being kicked with the message "DWPSS has detected you are using counterfeit products"?
There are two possible reasons:
1. You're using an outdated version of **DWProx Net2+**, **SCO v3**, or **Scan & Shop** released prior to **26/01/24**. Update your products via [Axon](https://axon.whitehill.group) to resolve the issue. See [this message](https://discord.com/channels/616745092279173151/1169430086500491375/1200237894430892072) in our [Discord server](https://discord.whitehill.group/) for detailed update instructions.
2. You've tampered with your product, which triggered DWPSS protection. If this occurred, please open a support ticket for assistance.
