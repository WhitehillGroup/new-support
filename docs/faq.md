# Frequently Asked Questions

Check out our frequently asked questions — the answer you're looking for might already be here.

==- How can I get my products?
Our user-friendly dashboard makes it easy to purchase and download all of our products. Visit [Axon](https://axon.whitehill.group) to get started.
==- Can I purchase products directly without using Robux?
Yes! Please use [Axon](https://axon.whitehill.group).
==- Do you provide product transfers?
We've introduced product transfers through [Axon](https://axon.whitehill.group), giving you greater control over how and where you use your products.
==- Can I join your support team?
We don’t frequently hire new support team members, as our current team is often able to manage the volume of tickets. While we occasionally post applications, we typically hand-select new team members. Keep an eye out for any openings we may announce.
==- Why are my products becoming unanchored once rotated in-game?
If you're using the F3X plugin in Studio, please avoid it when working with our products, as it tends to break welds. If you're using Studio's standard rotation tools, make sure to select everything within the product's group to prevent welds from being automatically removed.
==- Why are my products saying that HTTP Service is not enabled, even though it is?
There are a few possible causes for this error. Please check the following:
1. Double-check that HTTP Requests are enabled in Home > Game Settings > Security. It's easy to miss clicking "Save" after enabling it.
2. HTTP requests may not work in local (non-published) games. Make sure your game is published to Roblox. You will need to restart Roblox Studio after doing this.
3. Too many scripts are making HTTP requests. While our products are optimized to minimize HTTP usage and avoid hitting Roblox’s limits, other scripts in your game may still generate enough requests to exceed those limits. If our products are unable to connect due to this, they will automatically retry after a short period. However, if the issue persists, they may fail to start. We recommend identifying and removing any scripts that may be overloading HTTP Service.
==- Are there items provided with any of our retail products?
We provide an example item with each of our products; however, it's up to you to create the items for your game. Use the example product to understand how products are configured, and build from there.
==- Why am I getting kicked with the message "DWPSS has detected you are using counterfeit products"?
There are 2 reasons this may be happening:
1. You are using a version of DWProx Net2+, SCO v3 or Scan & Shop that was released prior to 26/01/24. You should update your Net2, SCO v3 and Scan & Shop with the latest versions from [Axon](https://axon.whitehill.group) to resolve the issue. Please see [this message](https://discord.com/channels/616745092279173151/1169430086500491375/1200237894430892072) in our [Discord server](https://discord.whitehill.group/) for more detailed update instructions.
2. You have tampered with your product - if you have done this and triggered DWPSS, please open a support ticket.
