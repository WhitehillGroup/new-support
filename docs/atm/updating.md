# Updating Your SelfServ ATM

![](/assets/banners/whg_atmupdate.png)

Want to keep your ATM on latest software? Right this way.

!!!
Before getting started, download the latest version of this product from [Axon](https://axon.whitehill.group).
!!!
!!!warning
This page assumes familiarity with Roblox Studio's Explorer and basic model hierarchy manipulation.
!!!

---

=== Step 1 - Preparations
- Duplicate your `JSM | ATM V3` model and store it outside your workspace.

In case anything goes south, you will always have a restore point.
===

=== Step 2 - Updating
- From the fresh copy of JSM ATM, copy the `Deploy` script. (Inside `JSM | ATM V3`)
- In your existing installation, delete the old `Deploy` script, and paste in the new `Deploy` script.
===

=== Step 3 - Test
After updating, confirm that the ATM boots without throwing any errors to the Console.

!!!
In case any errors occur, check the release notes in [**#product-updates**](https://ptb.discord.com/channels/616745092279173151/1169430975911043212) for any special instructions.
