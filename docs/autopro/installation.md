# AutoPro Installation

!!!
Before getting started, download the latest version of this product from [Axon](https://axon.whitehill.group).
!!!
!!!warning
Ensure HTTP services are enabled before proceeding.
This can be done by visiting _Home > Game Settings > Security_ within Studio.
For more information visit [create.roblox.com](https://create.roblox.com/docs/studio/game-settings#security)
!!!

1. To insert your file, drag the product file into Roblox Studio while your game is fully loaded. Alternatively, you can use the Explorer context menu: right-click and select _Insert > Insert From File_.

2. Place and position your door, making sure all doors and controllers remain in their correct folders and models.

!!!warning Don't get caught out!
Each network can have only one controller. Choose the controller you want to use and delete any others to avoid potential errors.
!!!
!!!light 
You can add multiple doors to a single network to control several sets of doors from one controller.
To do this, simply duplicate the doors using _Ctrl + D_ to ensure they stay within the correct model.
!!!

3. Configure your doors. They work out of the box, but we recommend reviewing the configuration file located at _AutoPro v2 > Settings_ to ensure they function as intended and have the correct whitelist settings.
