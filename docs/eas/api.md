JSM EAS exposes a simple API for you to interact with, or get the data it's sending. The EAS has a single `Node` [BindableEvent](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BindableEvent).

## Syntax

### Receiving

```lua
workspace["JSM | Intelli-Sense EAS"].Node.Event:Connect(function(eventType: string, source: string, zone: number, player: Player): ()
	print(player.Name, "triggered a", source, "in zone", tostring(zone));
end);
```

EAS supports scripts that listen to events, and will fire them everytime it's triggered.

!!!light What do these mean?
- **eventType**: (`string`) This will always be "ALARM".
- **source**: (`string`) Source location, will always be "Sensor" if coming from JSM EAS.
- **zone**: (`number`) Zone number as set in the Sensor.
- **player**: (`Player`) Player who triggered the event (shoplifting.)
!!!

### Sending

```lua
workspace["JSM | Intelli-Sense EAS"].Node.Event:Fire(eventType, source, zone, player);
```

Alternatively, EAS also supports listening to events, allowing you to use external scripts to trigger it manually.

!!!light What do these mean?
- **eventType**: (`string`) This will always be "ALARM".
- **source**: (`string`) Source location, set to anything you like.
- **zone**: (`number`) Zone number to trigger.
- **player**: (`Player`) Player to set as the triggering person.
