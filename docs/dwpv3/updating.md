# Updating Your V3

![](/static/assets/banners/whg_v3update.png)

Keep the doors from closing in on you (again.)

!!!
Before getting started, insert the latest version of this product from [Toolbox](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/4998244735/DWProx-Access-Control) into your game.
!!!
!!!warning
This page assumes familiarity with Roblox Studio's Explorer and basic model hierarchy manipulation.
!!!

---

=== Step 1 - Preparations
- Duplicate your door model and store it outside your workspace.

In case anything goes south, you will always have a restore point.
===

=== Step 2 - Updating
- From a fresh copy of V3, under `DWProx` **->** `Settings` there's a `Loader` script, copy it.
- For every door using V3, follow the same path, and replace the old `Loader` script with the new `Loader`.

!!!warning
DWProx V3 doesn't have a deployment/global script. All doors/V3 installs **need to be updated manually**.
!!!
===

=== Step 3 - Test
After updating all/one of the doors, test if it boots and functions without throwing any errors to the Console.

!!!
In case any errors occur, check the release notes in [**#product-updates**](https://ptb.discord.com/channels/616745092279173151/1169430975911043212) for any special instructions.
